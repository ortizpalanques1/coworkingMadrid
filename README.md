# coworkingMadrid

## Business Question
This project started when my company thought about participating in a joint venture to rent co-working spaces. Information about current prices was needed to take an informed decision, comparing prices based on the location of our building. Most of the offers were in the Spanish portal Milanuncios, so we decided to use it as a source of information.

## Final Products
1. Scrap data from Milanuncios about co working spaces in Madrid, Spain.
2. Creates the average price by zone every week.
